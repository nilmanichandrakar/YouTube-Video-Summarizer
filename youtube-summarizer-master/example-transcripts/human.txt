Looks like for 2018, that, that's going to be how we get away from it. That's the avoidance of the notch. So this is what I'm going to call the hole punch. So yes of course different companies are going to call it different things. Samsung will call it the Infinity-O display. This one we have here is the Honor View 20 from Huawei. They don't really call it anything, so we'll just call it the hole punch. So there's all kinds of interesting things about this phone, from the blue chevron back that changes the way it looks depending on how light hits it which is really cool, to the four thousand milliamp-hour battery, to the fourty-eight megapixel main camera, the 6 gigs of ram, but what I'm here for is the hole punch display, so.
