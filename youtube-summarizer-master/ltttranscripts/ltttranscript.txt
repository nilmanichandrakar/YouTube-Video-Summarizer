00:00
gamers have always looked for ways to be
00:02
more immersed in their games vibration
00:04
inducing bodysuits omnidirectional
00:06
treadmills headphones with pinpoint
00:09
location accurate sounds these gadgets
00:12
promise to take us deeper into the
00:14
worlds we love but there has never been
00:17
something quite like the vortex 4d
00:21
environmental simulator Wow I mean look
00:25
at this it's actually blowing air at him
00:28
like in the game so how is it Riley are
00:32
you immersed my eyes are kind of dry
00:43
okay
00:45
yeah let's talk about that
00:54
antlion audios new mod mic wireless
00:57
features low latency high recording
01:00
quality LED status indicators up to 12
01:02
hours of battery life and more check it
01:05
out at the link in the video description
01:06
so this curious device comes to us
01:09
courtesy of a company called whirlwind
01:11
FX and it's called the vortex it's
01:14
supposed to increase game or video
01:16
immersion by blowing air at your face
01:20
which may not be quite as stupid as it
01:24
sounds so to differentiate their product
01:27
from just a USB powered desk fan the air
01:31
stream actually changes in intensity and
01:34
even in temperature depending on the
01:37
audio and video playing on your PC with
01:40
the basic idea being that if you see
01:42
like a snowy scene you'll feel blustery
01:45
gusts of wind and if there's a fiery
01:48
explosion you'll feel a hot blast so uh
01:51
Riley how'd that work well so there's an
01:55
intake fan at the back air is deflected
01:57
with a plate to either pass through a
01:59
heating element inside or to avoid it
02:02
before exiting through this beautiful
02:04
front nozzle now the vortex has a
02:06
desktop app that uses what whirlwind
02:09
Effects calls the e^x algorithm to
02:12
monitor and analyze the audio waveform
02:14
which informs the intensity of the wind
02:17
blast the video meanwhile informs how
02:21
hot or cold the air will be the orange
02:24
and red in fire and explosions translate
02:26
to heat while bluish colors translate to
02:29
cold I mean that's really cool but you
02:32
didn't actually tell you does it work I
02:35
mean sort of you you should probably try
02:40
for yourself to be honest ok yeah get in
02:44
here alright I'm ready to get immersed
02:46
oh yeah get in Myrtle ok so this is what
02:48
kind of smells like electronics your
02:50
referee yeah I thought that would go
02:52
away really it smells like one of those
02:56
cheap heaters you know so this is not a
02:58
great first impression
03:00
all right I'm gonna I'm opening up my
03:02
mind okay I'm closing these earphones
03:04
and opening up my mind so this is their
03:07
demo video this is the demo video and it
03:09
works like as soon as you make something
03:11
fullscreen then the e ex algorithm will
03:14
start like okay now it's analyzed okay
03:17
so this is best-case scenario this is
03:18
best-case scenario according to the
03:20
makers of the vortex I've got to give
03:25
credit where credit is due
03:26
yeah does feel more like I am outside
03:29
right right and I watch this part watch
03:31
this part that slows down - slows down
03:34
in slow motion then it gets going again
03:36
oh oh wipeout sort of there is
03:41
definitely a legitimate difference in in
03:45
feeling yeah this should be blasting
03:51
past your heads oh yeah hugely like it's
03:55
just kind of a gentle breeze I mean a
03:57
gentle breeze is better than nothing
04:00
that's true very true in much the same
04:03
way that you know force feedback through
04:05
her controller was considered
04:06
revolutionary for gaming even though
04:08
obviously you know a slap shot feels
04:12
different from array you know it's like
04:15
it's blowing only at one side of my face
04:16
though hmm yeah yeah part of the problem
04:24
okay okay so clearly the solution is two
04:28
of them
04:29
my eyes are drying out though I've only
04:32
been here for like three minutes yeah
04:34
how does Batman fight Superman that's
04:36
stupid okay
04:38
Batman has and he's dead now he's human
04:40
yeah again it's not really picking up on
04:43
the correct intensity because yeah it
04:45
kind of relies on the movement of the
04:47
screen itself and it's just kind of
04:49
going yeah you're outside there's
04:51
probably a breeze I do hear can't try an
04:54
actual game yeah okay so I'm getting air
04:57
blown at me whoa some warm air blown at
05:00
me that lots of warmness yep I'm running
05:03
along there's some air blowing up okay
05:04
I'm standing next to fire starting in
05:07
the fire don't kill yourself getting a
05:08
little hotter do you feel like you're
05:10
actually fighting demons
05:12
he'll infested Mars the smell is kind of
05:16
distracting I mean it kind of smells
05:19
like burning I don't feel like there's a
05:22
strong connection between the airbursts
05:26
right the action on the screen and that
05:28
can almost make it feel like you you're
05:30
reminded that you're not in the game
05:32
world you're sitting at a desk with
05:35
pretending to be the doom guy you're not
05:38
actually the doom guy you know you know
05:41
my mouth I am the doom guy okay
05:43
hey that's fine man you live your life
05:45
so is this the part where you make fun
05:47
of my rocket League skills no there was
05:52
some wind Wow see that's kind of
05:55
interesting when when when the explosion
05:57
when you get your goal it's like it blew
05:59
a thing at me so watch this watch it a
06:02
little bit yeah love the vortex embrace
06:06
the vortex now it's time to really enter
06:10
the matrix states immerse yourself that
06:13
matrix reference is so so now and edgy
06:17
well what are you ready player ready
06:18
player one I'm just gonna I've actually
06:22
never played the skinny before um
06:24
yeah throw it yeah um grab that bat back
06:28
you got to go slower man go slower why
06:31
would I go slower because time moves as
06:33
fast as you do it's like a just
06:39
[Music]
06:45
but there you go I can't believe I've
06:51
never played this game no the doodad is
06:57
not contributing in any meaningful way
06:59
whatsoever maybe part of it is that I'm
07:02
standing further than you were yeah it's
07:05
not mine but also you said you felt it
07:07
it's not super or hot and this is this
07:09
is consistent with what so in response
07:12
to my own question does the vortex
07:16
increase immersion well it does
07:19
something does something the first time
07:22
you watch a video or play a game there's
07:24
you're you're gonna have all whoa cool
07:28
moment or like maybe uh whoa warm breeze
07:32
moment and it's at its best when there's
07:35
a sudden change in scenery that's
07:37
accompanied by a blast of air and there
07:41
are more than one moments when it
07:45
actually works pretty well but the
07:48
issues that we found that while actually
07:50
gaming like not just watching the vortex
07:53
demo reel 2018 whirlwinds detection
07:56
engine just isn't smart enough to tell
08:00
the difference between stepping out of a
08:02
cave into the icy air and flipping on a
08:06
light switch so it mostly translates
08:09
into bursts of air being sent at your
08:11
head every time you move your view from
08:14
side to side which maybe makes a little
08:17
bit of sense there's like a little bit
08:18
of wind on my face my hair the issue is
08:21
that for every time the wind syncs up
08:23
with what's happening on screen there
08:25
are three to seventeen instances where
08:27
it doesn't like an event will occur
08:29
where you would expect to have a
08:31
corresponding blast of warm or cold air
08:33
and it's not there and then other times
08:36
you'll feel air on your face when you
08:37
shouldn't like when you're driving a car
08:40
flying an aircraft also I should hope
08:43
that you don't feel air on your face
08:45
when you're in a Starfighter because
08:47
then something is definitely wrong
08:48
because you're in space yeah so yeah for
08:52
the most part it just feels like gaming
08:54
with
08:56
like an oscillating fan that's blowing
08:58
at you from one side which can actually
09:00
cause a bit of cognitive dissonance when
09:05
the explosion is happening over on the
09:07
other side since the vortex is supposed
09:09
to make gaming more immersive I guess
09:12
one thing we haven't addressed yet is
09:13
motion sickness so the feeling of motion
09:16
sickness is apparently caused by a
09:18
mismatch between what a player is
09:20
experiencing in game and in real life so
09:23
Ansel one of our editors here gets
09:26
motion sickness from using VR normally
09:28
so we had him playing a racing game with
09:31
the vortex and his verdict it might be a
09:36
little better and then for comparison's
09:38
sake we hadn't played the game again
09:40
with a regular fan blowing at him and he
09:43
said that that was just as good bummer
09:47
looks like they probably could have
09:48
saved themselves some R&D; now for the
09:50
sake of science since the vortex
09:52
apparently uses colors to inform the
09:55
wind temperature to a certain degree we
09:57
wondered whether we could game the
09:58
system by displaying full screen solid
10:01
colors so what we did what is just bring
10:04
up a full screen you know light blue
10:09
solid color but switching between light
10:11
blue and orange didn't consistently
10:14
change the temperature instead like
10:16
before we simply got a burst of air
10:19
whenever the screen changed so air
10:22
temperature does change between hot and
10:24
cold when an actual scene is displayed
10:26
so there does seem to be some aspect of
10:28
the algorithm that informs that change
10:30
other than just color so maybe that's
10:33
whirlwind FX's actual end game to use
10:36
the vortex as a development tool to
10:39
continue to refine their sensing
10:41
technology something that does have
10:44
potential like I've done this bird
10:46
simulator thing in VR where the changing
10:49
fan blowing in front of you really
10:51
affects the way that you perceive your
10:53
rate of movement through the air but it
10:56
should be noted that that's with a
10:58
custom-built experience like there's a
11:00
whole rig that you strap yourself into
11:01
with a game that's specifically built
11:05
for it and it's unlikely that we're
11:06
gonna see
11:07
that kind of integration with mainstream
11:09
games anytime soon
11:11
so should you get this for me I'm gonna
11:15
say no not unless you've got a hundred
11:18
and twenty bucks burning a hole in your
11:20
pocket and you just desperately need
11:22
some kind of air ejection device to put
11:26
it out Riley do you have any closing
11:29
thoughts no sorry can't talk I'm too
11:31
immersed right now I'm very immersed
11:33
check out private Internet access VPN
11:36
PIAA hides your true IP address and
11:39
allows you to bypass geo restrictions
11:41
and censorship by making you appear as
11:43
though you are connecting from somewhere
11:45
else and you can use it on 5 devices at
11:48
once it also helps prevent attacks by
11:50
blocking unwanted connections it Auto
11:53
blocks all traffic if the VPN
11:54
disconnects and keeps your data out of
11:56
the hands of advertisers and other
11:59
activity tracking snoops with apps for
12:01
Windows Mac Android iOS Linux and chrome
12:04
there's always a PIAA client for you and
12:06
they have over 3,000 servers in 28
12:10
countries with no user logs so what are
12:13
